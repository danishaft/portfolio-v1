            <p className="grey"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a software developer my interest lies in developing products that solves real world problems and satisfies users needs, while providing an interesting experience. <br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm a fast learner and a patient listener, i pay attention to every detail and i have an insatiable hunger for learning and keeping up-to-date with the latest technologies and best practices that'll enable me build bug free, maintainable and readable code, which is a neccessity when trying to deliver products with maximum efficiency. I've gained experience working on various web and mobile applications using a variety of technologies and tools such as React, Figma, Firebase etc. I also have a good understanding on various engineering concepts like data structures, algorithms and design. I am interested in emerging technologies like blockchain, even machine learning, etc. <br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Im not coding, you can find me bowling and playing video games. I believe in maintaining a healthy work-life balance, and Im always looking for ways to stay active and engaged in my personal life. I'm currently looking to join a creative team and collaborate with designers, other devs, or anyone with an idea. Shoot me an email if you believe we'd be a good fit for each other. </p>
